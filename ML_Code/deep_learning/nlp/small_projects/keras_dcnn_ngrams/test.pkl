dead priest later evil spirit think one answer question course simple possessing entity scene determined whichever effects flashy camera work mr wainwright wants use time furthermore ending ridiculously neat little wrapup filmmakers compound problem ultimately turning film diatribe catholic church research gospel st thomas youll find suppressed church film seems claim readily available local library theres nothing catholics need worry though stigmatas religion offbase cant confused anything remotely resembling real catholic church wanted portray catholic priests mobsters gone allout equipped sharkskin suits tommy guns would far interesting im catholic fact care much catholic church cartoonish misrepresentation film considered realistic means rare see film fails many levels stigmata thoughtprovoking though would like definitely scary though pretends im sure tried pass horror film absolutely nothing scary story maybe attempt cover fact none scenes dramatic weight
